## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is interactive and allows two players to take turns, either as 'X' or 'O', on a 3x3 grid. The game includes a reset button to restart the game and a new game button that shows up when there's a winner or a draw.

## Game Design
The game consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a square with either 'X' or 'O'. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If all squares are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.

Win Conditions:Three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw Condition:All squares are filled and there is no winner.
